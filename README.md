The project, involves building a malware signature repository, creating an IDS model, and training an AI to predict attacks based on malware behavior.

I am currently working in the Operating Systems cluster of a project focused on proactive APT attack detection. My responsibilities include learning about the filesystems of different operating systems and understanding how malware executables are hidden. To achieve this, I have been actively engaged in digital forensics and malware analysis.
